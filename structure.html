  <p>Hello, my name is Arvoyea Moore. Welcome to my first website created with HTML</p>
  <p>I'm still new at this, and still have a lot to learn applying</p>
<p>This is all focused on structure and function. Style will be added later on!</p>
<p>Here's hoping this leads to a new set of skills I can lead a better life with.</p>
